Scheme version used: [r5rs](https://schemers.org/Documents/Standards/R5RS/HTML/)

The program I will be working on is function that will take in a US dollar amount
and convert it to other currencies in euros, south korean won, Chinese Yuan, and Japanese Yen.
For input, I'll be taking in the USD amount to be converted and for output I will have a line specifying which currency is displayed and variable containing the value of the type of currency.\
In order to get my desired output, the formula I will be using will be to multiply my USD amount by the conversion rate of each currency and storing that inside of its respective variable.
