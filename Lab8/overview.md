# Lab 8 overview
**Problem:** I do not think that I will be qualified enough once I graduate to get a job, leading me to become homeless, a disappointment, and suicidal. My solution to this is to create a phising website by luring unsuspecting users to enter their apple login information to "claim their free iphone 12". By stealing user information I will be able to afford a decent lifestyle without having to market my skills in the job market.

### website details
This website is created with vanilla JS with the utilization of bootstrap for design. Some components that will be needed on this website will be a form to extract login info, and a claim screen showing the iphone 12. 

**Design specs:** The login window will be hidden on site load up and only show once the user presses login. To ensure that they login, I will have an event that prompts to user to first sign in before they can claim their "prize". No if statement will be needed on the claim screen because we only need the user to give their login information.
