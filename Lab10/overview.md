# Lab 10 overview
This is a template that I've pulled from my lab 8 assignment with some added css additions to match this lab. Some of the changes made were the login button and only the login window to show during the login prompt with the main content appearing again if submit or cancel is entered, correct hiding and showing of the login window, correct margins claim window to add streamers as well as a copyright style at the bottom to make the site look more real.

### website details
This website is created with vanilla JS with the utilization of bootstrap for design. Some components that will be needed on this website will be a form to extract login info, and a claim screen showing the iphone 12. 

**Design specs:** The login window will be hidden on site load up and only show once the user presses login. To ensure that they login, I will have an event that prompts to user to first sign in before they can claim their "prize". No if statement will be needed on the claim screen because we only need the user to give their login information.
