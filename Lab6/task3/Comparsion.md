# Git
### Likes:
- easy setup if you want do create the repository locally before pushing
- more independence when working locally when it comes to creating and pushing new branches
- merges after all changes are done
- can change what you want without interferring with someone elses work
### Dislikes
- can go end up going through a mountain of changes if you don't pull regularly

# Subversion
### Likes:
- cloning process is simple like with Git
- commiting commands are straightforward

### Dislikes:
- must always be working with an up to date main branch
- can't push a new folder if it doesn't exist on the main branch
- can't push changes from the main svn folder
- trying to set up in the terminal without cloning the repo involes more work

## Thoughts
Git and subversion are very similar in their end goal but differ in how they get there. when it comes to processes such as adding and committing changes, they're similar in that they both have the same syntax of adding and committing. Another key thing between them are the syntaxes of the commands ex: git (command) or svn (command). This makes it easier going from one after learning another. svn seems nice once it's set up to work on, but I'm more partial to git partly because of how much I'm used to it and the freedom it allows when coding before pushing changes.

## TLDR:
- Git is my preferred version since subversion involves too much manual work/non intuitive thinking when creating a repository or working in a trunk/branch.\

- Svn is better if everyone needs to work on the most up to date version at all times, while git thrives with this and also if you want to work offline\

- the commands to track or commit are similar and the syntax from each take from eachother
